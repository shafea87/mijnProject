                <p>
                The skills and requirements of a web application developer are divided into three categories:
               </p>
                <!-- Unordered list-->
                <ul>

                <!-- Heading 2 -->
                <h2>Technical skills</h2>

                <p>
                The technical expertise of the developer is one of the most important things the employer pays attention to. The development of web-based information systems is divided into several different areas; back-end and front-end and other areas of expertise include: also version management and collaboration tools.
                </p>

                <!-- Front end section -->
                <section>

                             <!-- Heading 3 -->
                <h3>Front-End</h3>

                <p>
                Front-End developers are the ones who take the design and develop it for the webpage that works.
                The most important skills of the Front-End expert are HTML, CSS and JavaScript language management. HTML and CSS are the basic skills of a web developer whose management is essential. JavaScript is important because it can create dynamic functionalities for websites and as a user can react with sites.
                </p>

                <!-- Heading 4 -->
                <h4>HTML and CSS</h4>

                <p>
                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the two key technologies for website building by a front-end developer. HTML provides a layout of a page, a CSS (visual and aural) layout for multiple devices. In addition to graphics and scripts, HTML and CSS form the basis for web sites and web applications [1].
                </p>

                <figcaption>Figure 1. HTML Example</figcaption>
                </figure>
                HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages (Figure 1). HTML gives authors the means to:


                <!-- Unordered list-->
                <ul>


                <li>Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.</li>

                <li>Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.</li>

                <li>Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.</li>

                <li>Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly in their documents.[1.]</li>

                </ul>


                <p>
                With HTML, authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The elements of the language label pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,” and so on [1].
                </p>

                <figure>


                <img src="images/css.png" width="400px"height="300px"alt="CSS Example"/>
                <figcaption>Figure 2. CSS Example</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts (Figure 2). It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers [1].
                </p>

                <p>
                CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.
                The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or: content) from presentation [1].
                </p>

                <p>
                CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used by any page that references the CSS file. Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once. For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site. If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs to be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text [8].
                </p>

                <!-- Heading 4 -->
                <h4>JavaScript and jQuer</h4>

                <figure>


                <img src="images/JavaScript.png" width="400px"height="300px"alt="JavaScript Example"/>
                <figcaption>Figure 3. JavaScript Example</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>
                JavaScript is the most famous scripting language on web pages and is also used by many non-browser environments, such as node.js and Apache CouchDB. JavaScript is a light dynamic programming language that supports object-oriented programming style. (Figure 3.)
                In some cases, a very simple site is good, but in situations where interactive features - audio and video, games, scrolling features, page animations - are required, JS is the tool used to implement them [3].
                </p>

                <p>
                For JS, it is good to keep in mind the collection of JQuery libraries, plug-ins, and extensions that will make JS's use faster and easier on the site. jQuery takes common tasks that require multiple rows of JS code and compress them into a form that can be executed in a single line. This is a great help when encoding with JS [3].
                </p>

                <!-- Back end section -->
                <section>



                <!-- Heading 3 -->
                <h3>Back-End</h3>
                <p>
                Web application implementation is rarely just a front-end development. Also required is a server-side application that includes databases, background drives, and faster performance.
                The site's back-end consists of a server, an application, and a database. A back-end developer builds and maintains a technology that enables components that together allow the front side of the site to exist [2].
                In order for server, application and database to communicate with each other, the back-end programmers use a server-side languages ​​such as PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, Perl and .Net. It is also useful if the developer knows how Wordpress (Wordpress is written in PHP, so its functions, functions, plug-ins, and themes use the same language) or Mongo DB work.
                To find, store, and edit data, application developers use tools such as MySQL, Oracle and SQL Server.
                The Back-end developer must have a strong knowledge of Back-End programming, but also an understanding of front-end technologies (such as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript) to communicate with other team members. This role also needs to manage security issues and hosting environments and database management [5].
                The back-end developer's job description is extensive (from writing code to database management, optimization, knowledge of the most popular software frameworks), so it is not prepared directly from school, but it takes years of experience to collect skills [6].
                </p>

                <h4>Web development frameworks</h4>

                <p>
                Web Frames provide tools and libraries to simplify common web development activities, they exist in almost all programming languages.
                Web frameworks help web developers achieve success in their business and provide their customers with good web development services.
                </p>

                <p>
                Here are some of the most popular web frames today:
                </p>

                <!-- Unordered list -->
                <ul>

                <li>Django (Python)</li>
                <li>Node.js(JavaScript)</li>
                <li>Express.js (JavaScript)</li>
                <li>Ruby</li>
                <li>Lareval (PHP).</li>

                </ul>
                <!-- Heading 4 -->
                <h4>Version Control Tools</h4>

                <p>
                As any application development process grows, using version control becomes almost inevitable.
                As the application development process grows, version control becomes necessary. Versi-based management tools (such as open source Git, CVS, SVN, etc.) are tools that allow the developer to track changes so that they can return to the previous work version and find out what went wrong [4]. Here you can track changes and manage source code. In addition to distributed, Versionhallin tools are also local and centralized.
                </p>

                <!-- Heading 4 -->
                <h4>Debugging</h4>
                <p>
                Buge can't be avoided. In order for work to progress, the developer must test their code for errors, so the ability to test and repair is one of the most important skills for a web developer [4].
                </p>

                <!-- Heading 4 -->
                <h4>Browser Developer Tools</h4>
                <p>

                Browser development tools usually consist of an Inspector and a JavaScript console. With the help of the inspector, you can see what the HTML of the page impressions shows, which CSS is associated with each element of the page, and you can also edit the HTML and CSS code and see the changes as such. The JS console can be used to view possible errors that the browser is trying to perform in the JS code [4].
               </p>

                <h2>Personality</h2>

                <p>
                The advantage of a web developer is that he is a strong problem solver and has the ability to draw attention to detail. Work is facilitated if he / she can receive feedback on his / her work, manage his / her time and prioritize tasks accordingly.
                Identifying and defining errors is an essential part of the job, because it is not always sure where the error is. A web developer rarely if ever works alone, so team and collaborative skills are very important. Communication skills are also needed, because there are many contacts with clients or managers at work. At work, pressure control is also important.
                Technology is constantly evolving, so the developer must keep an eye on what is happening in the world in the technology field.
                </p>

                <!-- Heading 2 -->
                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <p>

                Upon graduation, the web developer already has knowledge of the most important computer languages, coding and technologies. However, learning how to go to work is more time-consuming.
                The more a web developer has work experience, the more demanding the job he can seek. As time goes by, he can also set up his own business or move on to more demanding tasks.
                The web developer can also study and certify their certifications (Microsoft Certified Developer Developer, AWS Certified Developer, Oracle Application Express, etc.) during their career [7].
